            "\n*What is a Star?* 🌟\nA star is a massive, glowing ball of hot gases, mainly hydrogen and helium, that produces heat and light. The Sun is the closest star to Earth, and stars are found in large groups called galaxies. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, contains billions of stars!",
            "\n*How Do Stars Shine?* ✨\nStars shine due to nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms combine to form helium. This process releases a huge amount of energy, which appears as heat and light, making stars bright in the night sky.",
            "\n*Types of Stars* 🔵\nStars come in various sizes, colors, and brightness levels. Examples include Red Dwarf Stars, which are small and cool; Yellow Stars, like the Sun; Blue Giant Stars, which are hot and bright; Red Giant and Supergiant Stars, which are large and cooler; and White Dwarfs and Neutron Stars, which are the remains of dead stars.",
            "\n*Life Cycle of a Star* 🌌\nStars are born in nebulae, grow through nuclear fusion, and age by becoming Red Giants or Supergiants. They eventually die, with smaller stars becoming white dwarfs, while bigger stars explode into supernovas, forming neutron stars or black holes.",
            "\n*Why Do Stars Twinkle?* 🌠\nStars twinkle because of Earth's atmosphere. The light from stars bends as it passes through different layers of air, causing the twinkling effect.",
            "\n*Famous Stars and Constellations* 🌠\nFamous stars include the Sun, the Pole Star (Dhruva Tara), Sirius (Dog Star), and stars in the Orion constellation like Betelgeuse and Rigel. Constellations like the Big Dipper (Saptarishi) help locate the Pole Star.",
            "\n*How Do Scientists Study Stars?* 🔭\nScientists study stars using telescopes, spectroscopy, and radio waves. Telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope allow observation, while spectroscopy helps understand a star’s temperature and composition.",
            "\n*Importance of Stars* 🌟\nStars provide light and heat, aid in navigation, create new elements, and help scientists understand the universe. The Sun makes life on Earth possible, and stars help us learn about space.",
            "\n*Interesting Facts About Stars* 🤩\nStars like the Sun are much larger than Earth, and some stars even have planets called exoplanets orbiting them. Neutron stars are incredibly dense, and black holes form when very big stars die."

            "\n*What is a Black Hole?* 🌌\nA black hole is a mysterious object in space that has extremely strong gravity—so strong that nothing can escape it, not even light! Imagine a giant vacuum cleaner in space that sucks in everything around it—that’s how powerful a black hole is! Black holes are invisible because they do not give off any light. Scientists can only study them by observing the objects around them.",
            "\n*How is a Black Hole Formed?* 🌠\nBlack holes are born from dying stars. When a very large star (much bigger than our Sun) runs out of fuel, it collapses under its own gravity. This causes an explosion called a supernova.\nAfter the explosion:\n✅ If the star is small → It becomes a white dwarf.\n✅ If the star is medium-sized → It becomes a neutron star.\n✅ If the star is huge → It collapses into a black hole!",
            "\n*Parts of a Black Hole* 🕳️\nA black hole has three main parts:\n1️⃣ Singularity – The center of the black hole where gravity is infinite. Everything is crushed into a tiny point.\n2️⃣ Event Horizon – The boundary around the black hole. Once something crosses this line, it can never come back!\n3️⃣ Accretion Disk – A glowing ring of gas and dust around the black hole, heated up as it is pulled inside.",
            "\n*Types of Black Holes* 🌀\n1️⃣ Stellar Black Holes 🌟\nFormed when a big star collapses. Mass is 5 to 20 times the mass of the Sun. Found throughout the universe.\n2️⃣ Supermassive Black Holes 🪐\nMillions or billions of times the mass of the Sun. Found at the center of galaxies.\nExample: Sagittarius A* – the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy.\n3️⃣ Intermediate Black Holes 🔭\nMedium-sized black holes, between stellar and supermassive. Scientists are still studying how they form.\n4️⃣ Primordial Black Holes ⚫\nSmallest black holes, formed just after the Big Bang. Their existence is still a mystery!",
            "\n*What Happens If You Fall Into a Black Hole?* 🤯\nIf you fall into a black hole, you will experience a process called spaghettification! Since gravity is stronger at the bottom than the top of your body, you would be stretched like spaghetti until you break apart! 😲 But don’t worry—there are no black holes close to Earth!",
            "\n*Can Black Holes Swallow the Entire Universe?* 🌍\nNo! Black holes only pull in objects that come too close. A black hole’s gravity works just like the gravity of any other object. If our Sun became a black hole (which it won’t), Earth would still orbit it safely at the same distance.",
            "\n*How Do Scientists Detect Black Holes?* 🛰️\nSince black holes do not emit light, scientists use special techniques to find them:\n🔭 Observing Stars Moving Around a Black Hole – If a star is orbiting 'nothing,' it might be a black hole!\n📡 X-ray Telescopes – Gas falling into a black hole heats up and emits X-rays.\n🌌 Gravitational Waves – When two black holes merge, they create ripples in space-time that scientists can detect.",
            "\n*Famous Black Holes and Discoveries* 🌠\n⭐ First Ever Image of a Black Hole (2019) – Scientists took a photo of a supermassive black hole in the Messier 87 (M87) galaxy using the Event Horizon Telescope.\n⭐ Sagittarius A* – The supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy.\n⭐ Stephen Hawking’s Theory – The famous scientist Stephen Hawking discovered that black holes can slowly lose energy and shrink over time!",
            "\n*Fun Facts About Black Holes* 🤩\n✅ Black holes do not suck—they pull objects in due to gravity!\n✅ Time slows down near a black hole due to strong gravity.\n✅ Some black holes can be as small as an atom but have the mass of a mountain!\n✅ If you replaced the Sun with a black hole of the same mass, Earth would still orbit it normally!\n✅ Black holes can merge to form bigger black holes!",
            "\n*Are There Black Holes Near Earth?* 🌍❓\nNo! The closest known black hole is about 1,000 light-years away in a star system called HR 6819. It is far enough that it does not affect Earth.",
            "\n*India and Black Hole Research* 🇮🇳\n🔭 Indian scientists contribute to black hole research through ISRO and institutions like:\nTIFR (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research)\nIUCAA (Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics)\nIn 2016, Indian scientists helped detect gravitational waves from black holes using LIGO-India!",
            "\n*Conclusion* 🌌\nBlack holes are one of the most fascinating and mysterious objects in space. They are born from massive stars, have extreme gravity, and play a big role in the universe."

            "What is the Sun? ☀️\n- The Sun is a giant, glowing ball of hot  gases at the center of our solar system. It is made mostly of hydrogen and helium and provides light, heat, and energy to Earth. Without the Sun, life on Earth would not exist!",
            "*Basic Facts About the Sun* ✅\n- Age: About 4.6 billion years old.\n- Distance from Earth: 150 million km (takes 8 minutes for sunlight to reach us!).\n- Diameter: 1.4 million km (109 times wider than Earth!).\n- Temperature: About 5,500°C on the surface and more than 15 million°C at the core!\n- Rotation: The Sun spins on its axis, but different parts rotate at different speeds!",
            "*Structure of the Sun* 🔥\n- The Sun has different layers, each with a special function:\n1️⃣ Core (Center of the Sun): The hottest part, with temperatures over 15 million°C. Nuclear fusion happens here—hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing a huge amount of heat and light.\n2️⃣ Radiative Zone: Energy from the core slowly moves outward. It takes thousands of years for light to pass through this zone!\n3️⃣ Convective Zone: Heat rises and cooler gases sink, creating a boiling motion (like hot water in a pot!).\n4️⃣ Photosphere (Visible Surface): The layer we see from Earth. It gives off sunlight and has dark spots called sunspots.\n5️⃣ Chromosphere: A thin, reddish layer seen during a solar eclipse. Temperature increases as you move outward!\n6️⃣ Corona (Outer Atmosphere): The hottest outer layer, seen during a solar eclipse. Extends millions of kilometers into space!",
            "*Why Does the Sun Shine?* 💡\n- The Sun shines because of nuclear fusion. In the core, hydrogen atoms combine to form helium. This releases a huge amount of energy in the form of light and heat. This process has been going on for billions of years and will continue for billions more!",
            "*Importance of the Sun* 🌞\n- The Sun is very important for life on Earth. Here’s why:\n✅ Gives Us Light and Heat – Without the Sun, Earth would be dark and freezing.\n✅ Supports Plant Growth – Plants use sunlight for photosynthesis to make food.\n✅ Creates Weather and Seasons – The Sun’s heat moves air and water, causing winds, clouds, and rain.\n✅ Helps in Solar Energy – We use sunlight to generate electricity (solar panels).\n✅ Keeps Planets in Orbit – The Sun’s gravity holds Earth and other planets in place!",
            "*The Sun and Indian Culture* 🇮🇳\n- In India, the Sun has been worshipped for centuries as a source of energy and life.\n🔆 Surya – The Hindu Sun God, worshipped in festivals like Chhath Puja and Makar Sankranti.\n🔆 Konark Sun Temple – A famous temple in Odisha, built in honor of the Sun.\n🔆 Surya Namaskar (Sun Salutation) – A yoga practice to show gratitude to the Sun.",
            "*Solar Eclipses: When the Sun Disappears!* 🌑\n- A solar eclipse happens when the Moon comes between the Earth and the Sun, blocking sunlight.\n- There are three types of solar eclipses:\n1️⃣ Total Solar Eclipse – The Sun is completely covered by the Moon.\n2️⃣ Partial Solar Eclipse – Only part of the Sun is blocked.\n3️⃣ Annular Solar Eclipse – The Moon is too far to cover the Sun completely, leaving a bright ring.\n- Safety Tip: Never look directly at the Sun during an eclipse! Use special glasses or indirect viewing methods.",
            "*Sunspots, Solar Flares, and Solar Storms* 🌞⚡\n- The Sun is not always calm—it has storms and explosions too!\n⭐ Sunspots – Dark, cooler spots on the Sun’s surface. They appear and disappear over time.\n⭐ Solar Flares – Huge bursts of energy that send out light and particles.\n⭐ Solar Storms – When the Sun releases powerful charged particles, they can affect satellites and power grids on Earth!",
            "*What Will Happen to the Sun in the Future?* 🌌\n- The Sun is about halfway through its life. In 5 billion years, it will:\n1️⃣ Expand into a Red Giant – It will become much bigger and swallow Mercury, Venus, and Earth!\n2️⃣ Shrink into a White Dwarf – After losing its outer layers, it will shrink into a small, hot star.\n3️⃣ Cool Down and Fade – Over billions of years, it will become a cold, dark object.",
            "*Fun Facts About the Sun* 🤩\n⭐ The Sun’s gravity is 28 times stronger than Earth’s!\n⭐ 1 million Earths can fit inside the Sun!\n⭐ The Sun makes up 99.8% of the Solar System’s mass.\n⭐ If you could drive a car to the Sun at 100 km/h, it would take 170 years to get there!\n⭐ The Sun moves around the Milky Way galaxy at 828,000 km/h!",
            "*How Do Scientists Study the Sun?* 🔭\n- Scientists use satellites and telescopes to study the Sun. Some important space missions include:\n🚀 Aditya-L1 (India’s First Solar Mission) – Launched by ISRO to study the Sun.\n🚀 SOHO (NASA & ESA) – Observes the Sun’s surface and storms.\n🚀 Parker Solar Probe (NASA) – The closest spacecraft to the Sun!",
            "*Conclusion* 🌞\n- The Sun is the most important star for Earth. It provides light, heat, and energy, controls our climate, and makes life possible. Scientists are still studying it to learn more about space and our universe."

            "*What is a Shooting Star?* 🌠\n- A shooting star is not actually a star! It is a small rock or dust particle from space that enters Earth’s atmosphere and burns up, creating a bright streak of light.\n This glowing streak is called a *meteor*.\n When many meteors appear at the same time, it is called a *meteor shower*.",
            "*How Do Shooting Stars Form?* 🚀\n1️⃣ *Space Debris* – Small rocks, dust, or ice from space (called meteoroids) float around in space.\n2️⃣ *Entering Earth’s Atmosphere* – When a meteoroid gets pulled towards Earth by gravity, it enters the atmosphere at high speed.\n3️⃣ *Friction and Heat* – The meteoroid rubs against air molecules and burns up, creating a bright streak of light.\n4️⃣ *A Shooting Star!* – The glowing meteor moves across the sky for a few seconds before disappearing.",
            "*What Are the Different Names?* 🤔\n🔹 *Meteoroid* – A small rock or dust floating in space.\n🔹 *Meteor* – A meteoroid that enters Earth’s atmosphere and burns up (this is what we call a shooting star).\n🔹 *Meteorite* – If a meteor survives the atmosphere and falls to Earth, it is called a meteorite.",
            "*Where Do Meteoroids Come From?* ☄️\n *Asteroids* – Leftover pieces of rock from the formation of the Solar System.\n *Comets* – Icy space objects that leave behind dust trails when they move close to the Sun.",
            "*Meteor Showers: A Rain of Shooting Stars!* 🌧️🌟\n- Sometimes, Earth passes through a cloud of space dust left behind by a comet. This causes many meteors to appear at the same time, creating a meteor shower.\n *Famous meteor showers:*\n  ✅ *Perseids (August)* – One of the most beautiful meteor showers.\n  ✅ *Geminids (December)* – Known for its bright and colorful meteors.\n  ✅ *Lyrids (April)* – A spring meteor shower with fast-moving meteors.\n 🔭 *Best Time to See a Meteor Shower* – Watch after midnight in a dark place, away from city lights.",
            "*Do Shooting Stars Really Grant Wishes?* 🌠🙏\n- Many cultures, including India, believe that seeing a shooting star is lucky. People make wishes when they see one.\n- In reality, shooting stars are just burning space rocks, but the belief makes them even more special!",
            "*Are Shooting Stars Dangerous?* ⚠️\n- No! Most shooting stars burn up in the sky before reaching Earth.\n- But sometimes, large meteors can survive and land as meteorites.\n 🚀 *Famous meteorite events:*\n  🔹 *Tunguska Event (1908, Russia)* – A meteor exploded in the air, flattening trees over a huge area.\n  🔹 *Chelyabinsk Meteor (2013, Russia)* – A meteor broke windows and caused minor injuries.\n  🔹 *Lonar Crater (Maharashtra, India)* – A crater formed by a meteorite impact thousands of years ago.",
            "*Fun Facts About Shooting Stars* 🤩\n⭐ The fastest meteors travel at 72 km per second!\n⭐ Some meteors glow in different colors due to metal content (green, blue, red, yellow!).\n⭐ Meteorites can be billions of years old, older than Earth!\n⭐ Around 25 million meteors enter Earth’s atmosphere every day, but most are too small to see.\n⭐ The Moon and Mars also have meteors, but they don’t burn up because there is no atmosphere!",
            "*Conclusion* 🌌\n- Shooting stars are not stars but burning space rocks that light up the night sky.\n- They are beautiful to watch and have fascinated humans for centuries."

            "*What is an Asteroid?* ☄️\n- Asteroids are rocky objects that orbit the Sun, just like planets, but they are much smaller and do not have an atmosphere.\n They are often called *“space rocks”* or *“minor planets”* because they are leftovers from the formation of our Solar System about 4.6 billion years ago.",
            "*Where Do Asteroids Come From?* 🌌\n- When the Solar System was forming, small pieces of rock and dust came together to form planets. Some leftover pieces never became a planet—these are asteroids.\n Most asteroids are found in the *Asteroid Belt*, a region between Mars and Jupiter that contains millions of asteroids of different sizes.",
            "*Types of Asteroids* 🌍\n1️⃣ *C-type (Carbonaceous) Asteroids* 🖤 – The most common type, dark-colored, and made of carbon-rich material. Found in the outer asteroid belt.\n2️⃣ *S-type (Silicaceous) Asteroids* 🪨 – Made of silicate (rocky) materials and metal, found in the inner asteroid belt.\n3️⃣ *M-type (Metallic) Asteroids* 🔩 – Made mostly of iron and nickel, found in the middle of the asteroid belt.",
            "*Size of Asteroids* 📏\n✅ *Largest Asteroid:* *Ceres* (950 km wide, almost a dwarf planet!).\n✅ *Smallest Asteroids:* Some are just a few meters wide!\n✅ *Most Asteroids:* Between 1 km to 100 km wide.\n- Unlike planets, asteroids do not have a round shape—they are irregular and bumpy!",
            "*Famous Asteroids* ☄️\n🔹 *Ceres* – The biggest asteroid, almost like a small planet.\n🔹 *Vesta* – The brightest asteroid, visible with the naked eye.\n🔹 *Eros* – The first asteroid studied closely by a spacecraft.\n🔹 *Apophis* – An asteroid that will pass very close to Earth in 2029.",
            "*Asteroids vs. Meteoroids vs. Comets* 🤔\n| Space Object  | What is it?  | Where is it found?  | What is it made of?   *Asteroid*  | Large rocky body | Orbits the Sun (mostly in the asteroid belt) | Rock & metal |\n| *Meteoroid*  | Small piece of an asteroid | Found in space | Rock & dust |\n| *Meteor*  | A meteoroid that burns up in Earth’s atmosphere (shooting star) | Falls towards Earth | Rock & dust |\n| *Meteorite*  | A meteor that lands on Earth | Found on Earth's surface | Rock & metal |\n| *Comet*  | A space object with a tail | Comes from the outer Solar System | Ice, dust & rock |",
            "*Can Asteroids Hit Earth?* 🌍☄️\n- Yes, but large asteroid impacts are rare. Small asteroids burn up in the atmosphere, but some big asteroids have hit Earth in the past.\n🚀 *Famous asteroid impacts:*\n🔹 *Dinosaur Extinction (66 million years ago)* – A giant asteroid 10 km wide crashed into Earth, leading to the extinction of dinosaurs.\n🔹 *Tunguska Event (1908, Russia)* – A small asteroid exploded in the air, flattening 2,000 square km of forest.\n🔹 *Chelyabinsk Meteor (2013, Russia)* – A meteor exploded in the sky, breaking windows and injuring people.\n- Scientists use telescopes and space missions to track asteroids that come close to Earth.",
            "*India and Asteroid Research* 🇮🇳\n *ISRO (Indian Space Research Organisation)* tracks asteroids using satellites and telescopes.\n- Indian scientists contribute to international asteroid monitoring programs.\n The *Aditya-L1 mission* is studying the Sun, which helps understand the effects of asteroids in space.",
            "*How Do Scientists Study Asteroids?* 🔭🚀\n- Scientists use space probes to visit asteroids and collect data.\n🌍 *Famous asteroid missions:*\n🔹 *NASA’s OSIRIS-REx* – Collected samples from asteroid Bennu.\n🔹 *Japan’s Hayabusa2* – Brought back samples from asteroid Ryugu.\n🔹 *NASA’s DART Mission* – Tested deflecting an asteroid to prevent future impacts.",
            "*Fun Facts About Asteroids* 🤩\n⭐ Some asteroids have their own moons!\n⭐ The total mass of all asteroids is less than the Moon!\n⭐ Some asteroids are made of gold, platinum, and rare metals!\n⭐ The first asteroid *Ceres* was discovered in 1801.\n⭐ If an asteroid the size of a football field hit Earth, it could destroy an entire city!",
            "*Conclusion* 🌌\n- Asteroids are fascinating space rocks that tell us about the early Solar System.\n- Scientists study them to learn about space and protect Earth from future asteroid impacts."

            "What is a Comet? ☄️\n- A comet is a small icy body that orbits the Sun. It is made of ice, dust, and rock.\n- When a comet moves close to the Sun, it heats up and forms a glowing tail, making it one of the most beautiful objects in the night sky!\n- Comets are often called “dirty snowballs” because they are mostly made of frozen gases and dust.",
            "*Parts of a Comet* 🧊🔥\n1️⃣ *Nucleus (The Core)* – The solid center of the comet, made of ice, rock, and dust. It can be 1 to 10 km wide or even bigger!\n2️⃣ *Coma (Glowing Atmosphere)* – When a comet gets close to the Sun, ice melts into gas, forming a bright cloud around the nucleus. The coma can be thousands of kilometers wide!\n3️⃣ *Tail (The Shining Streak in Space!)* – The Sun’s heat and solar wind push gas and dust away, creating a long, bright tail that always points away from the Sun.",
            "*Where Do Comets Come From?* 🤔\n1️⃣ *Kuiper Belt* – A region beyond Neptune with many icy objects. Short-period comets (like Halley’s Comet) come from here.\n2️⃣ *Oort Cloud* – A huge cloud of icy bodies far beyond the planets. Long-period comets (like Comet Hale-Bopp) come from here.",
            "*How Do Comets Travel?* 🚀\n- Comets move around the Sun in elliptical (oval-shaped) orbits.\n- Some take a few years to complete one orbit, while others take hundreds or even thousands of years!",
            "*Types of Comets* ☄️\n🔹 *Short-Period Comets* – Take less than 200 years to orbit the Sun (e.g., Halley’s Comet – 76 years).\n🔹 *Long-Period Comets* – Take more than 200 years (e.g., Comet Hale-Bopp – 2,500 years!).\n🔹 *Sungrazers* – Come very close to the Sun and may break apart.",
            "*Famous Comets* 🏆\n🌟 *Halley’s Comet* – The most famous comet, visible every 76 years (next in 2061).\n🌟 *Comet Hale-Bopp* – One of the brightest comets, seen in 1997.\n🌟 *Comet NEOWISE* – A beautiful comet visible from Earth in 2020.\n🌟 *Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9* – It crashed into Jupiter in 1994, showing scientists how comets can affect planets.",
            "*Difference Between Comets, Asteroids, and Meteors* 🤔\n *Comet* – Icy body that orbits the Sun, found in the Kuiper Belt or Oort Cloud, has a tail when near the Sun.\n *Asteroid* – Rocky object orbiting the Sun, found in the Asteroid Belt, no tail.\n *Meteor* – A meteoroid that enters Earth's atmosphere, burns up, and creates a bright streak (no tail).",
            "*What Happens If a Comet Hits Earth?* 🌍☄️\n- Most comets burn up before reaching Earth, but a large impact could cause major destruction.\n- Scientists track comets and asteroids to ensure none are on a collision course with Earth!",
            "*How Do Scientists Study Comets?* 🔭🚀\n🚀 *Rosetta Mission (ESA, 2014)* – First mission to land a robot on a comet (Comet 67P).\n🚀 *Deep Impact (NASA, 2005)* – Sent a probe to crash into a comet to study its interior.\n🚀 *Stardust (NASA, 1999)* – Collected dust from a comet’s tail and brought it back to Earth!",
            "*Comets in Indian Culture* 🇮🇳\n- In ancient India, comets were seen as mystical signs. Some thought they brought bad luck, while others believed they were messages from the gods.\n- Today, we know that comets are natural space objects that help us learn about the universe!",
            "*Fun Facts About Comets* 🤩\n⭐ Comets are older than Earth, dating back 4.6 billion years!\n⭐ Some comets have two tails – one of gas and one of dust!\n⭐ Scientists believe comets brought water to Earth billions of years ago!\n⭐ A comet's tail can be millions of kilometers long!\n⭐ Halley’s Comet has been seen for thousands of years – even by ancient Indians and Chinese!",
            "*Conclusion* 🌌\n- Comets are icy travelers in space that light up the night sky when they pass near the Sun.\n- Studying them helps us understand the history of our Solar System and the origins of water on Earth."

            "*What is a Telescope?* 🌟\n- A telescope is a tool used to see distant objects in space, such as stars, planets, and galaxies, more clearly.\n  *How it works:*\n  - It gathers light from objects in space and brings them into focus.\n  - This makes distant objects appear closer and more detailed.",
            "*How Does a Telescope Work?* 🔭\n- A telescope works like a super-powered magnifying glass:\n  *Light Collection:* The lens or mirror at the front of the telescope collects light. A larger lens or mirror collects more light, providing clearer images.\n  *Focusing Light:* Light is focused onto a point to form an image.\n  *Magnification:* The eyepiece and other lenses magnify the image, making distant objects appear closer.",
            "*Types of Telescopes* 🔭\n- There are mainly three types of telescopes:\n  *Refracting Telescopes (Refractors):*\n   - Use lenses to bend light to form an image.\n   - Example: A simple pair of binoculars.\n  *Reflecting Telescopes (Reflectors):*\n   - Use mirrors to collect and focus light.\n   - Advantages: No color distortion and larger sizes.\n  *Catadioptric Telescopes (Compound Telescopes):*\n   - Combine lenses and mirrors to improve image quality.\n   - Advantages: Compact and clearer images.",
            "*Parts of a Telescope* 🔧\n *Objective Lens/Mirror:* Gathers light from objects in space.\n *Eyepiece Lens:* Magnifies the image so we can see it clearly.\n *Focuser:* Adjusts the position of the eyepiece to bring the image into focus.\n *Mount:* Holds the telescope steady and lets it be pointed at different parts of the sky.",
            "*Why Are Telescopes Important?* 🌌\n- Telescopes allow us to explore space from Earth.\n  *They help us to:*\n   - Study stars, planets, and other objects in our solar system.\n   - Discover new things like distant galaxies, black holes, and exoplanets.\n   - Understand the universe and its formation.",
            "*How Telescopes Have Advanced* 🕰️\n *Early Telescopes:* The first telescopes were invented in the 1600s. Galileo Galilei used one to observe the Moon and Jupiter.\n *Modern Telescopes:* Today, telescopes are more advanced, like the Hubble Space Telescope that captures images of faraway galaxies and stars.",
            "*What Can You See with a Telescope?* 🔭\n- With a telescope, you can see objects millions of light-years away!\n  *Things you can observe:*\n   - The Moon’s surface, including craters and mountains.\n   - Planets like Jupiter, Saturn (with its rings), and Mars.\n   - Stars, nebulas, and distant galaxies."
